## Create Mac OS VPNs programmatically

This is a command-line tool written in Objective-C (transitioning to Swift) that can create VPN network configurations on your Mac.

It supports both *L2TP over IPSec* and *Cisco IPSec*.
Integration tests are run on Travis to ensure it's working properly.

## Requirements

* macOS High Sierra 10.13, Sierra 10.12, El Capitan 10.11, Yosemite 10.10, or Mavericks 10.9
* Administrator privileges (i.e. you've got to run it with sudo)

**Why sudo?**

The passwords of VPN services are stored in the System Keychain.
Only `sudo` or a [HelperTool](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/SecureCodingGuide/Articles/AccessControl.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002589-SW2) can write to the System Keychain.
I don't want you to have to deal with the complexity a HelperTool can entail (GUI authorization and upgrading), so we simply use `sudo`.

## Installation

If you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) installed, you can simply start a Terminal and run:

```bash
# See https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/search?q=macosvpn&type=Issues
brew install macosvpn
```

If not, you can run this curl command to get the compiled executable from Github:

```bash
# Make sure first that the directory /usr/local/bin exists
sudo bash -c "curl -L https://github.com/halo/macosvpn/releases/download/0.3.1/macosvpn > /usr/local/bin/macosvpn"
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/macosvpn
```

If that freaks you out (it should), you can compile it yourself if you have Xcode installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/halo/macosvpn.git
cd macosvpn
xcodebuild -configuration Debug
build/Debug/macosvpn
```

You can always run `macosvpn --version` to see the version currently installed on your system
and compare it to [the latest available version](https://github.com/halo/macosvpn/releases) on Github.

## Usage

Creating a single L2TP over IPSec VPN Service:

    sudo macosvpn create --l2tp Atlantic --endpoint atlantic.example.com --username Alice --password p4ssw0rd --shared-secret s3same

* Replace `--l2tp` with `--cisco` to create a Cisco IPSec instead.
* Groupnames can be specified with `--groupname`.
* Add `--force` to overwrite an existing VPN with the same name.

By default, L2TP is created with the "Send all traffic over VPN connection" option, also known as wildcard routing.
You can add the `--split` flag to **not** force all traffic over VPN.

#### Shortcuts

The same command but shorter:

    sudo macosvpn create l2tp Atlantic endpoint atlantic.example.com username Alice password p4ssw0rd shared-secret s3same

The same command even shorter:

    sudo macosvpn create -l Atlantic -e atlantic.example.com -u Alice -p p4ssw0rd -s s3same

The same command as short as possible:

    sudo macosvpn create -leups Atlantic atlantic.example.com Alice p4ssw0rd s3same


#### Creating multiple VPNs at once

Repeat the arguments for creating multiple Services at once (no matter which short version you use :)

    sudo macosvpn create -leups Atlantic atlantic.example.com Alice p4ssw0rd s3same \\
                         -leups Northpole northpole.example.com Bob s3cret pr1v4te

#### Deleting VPN services by name

These commands will prompt you for your password to allow changes to your Network configuration:

    macosvpn delete --name MyVPN --name AnotherOne
    macosvpn delete -n ThisOneToo

Run it with sudo to avoid the prompt:

    sudo macosvpn delete --name MyVPN

## Troubleshooting

* If you're stuck, try to add the `--debug` flag and see if it says something useful.

## Limitations

* It is not possible to add so called "configurations" for L2TP. See [this issue](https://github.com/halo/macosvpn/issues/17).

## Development

The `master` branch is always edge and may not be ready for production.

Integration tests are run using ruby. Simply look at the `before_script` and `script` sections in the [.travis.yml](https://github.com/halo/macosvpn/blob/master/.travis.yml#L6) file to see how to run the tests on your Mac.

When using Xcode it's important to remember that you need to compile this app in the `Debug` configuration and not the `Release` configuration. Otherwise you will end up with unexplainable [random crashes](https://github.com/halo/macosvpn/issues/13#issuecomment-217252496).

Useful commands for debugging:

```bash
# Show all current VPN service configurations
open /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist
```

```bash
# Show all Keychain Items and their access policies
security dump-keychain -a /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
```

## History and credits

Feel free to browse through the code of this application.
It's pretty small and straight-forward.

It all began with finding [this page](https://lists.apple.com/archives/macnetworkprog/2011/May/msg00032.html) you probably already found.
But it was not before [this practical example](https://lists.apple.com/archives/macnetworkprog/2013/Apr/msg00016.html) that I actually dared to try to implement this.
Then, google led me to [this page](https://lists.apple.com/archives/macnetworkprog/2007/Dec/msg00045.html) where I learned how to set the Shared Secret.
The last hurdle was to get the "Send all traffic over VPN" flag, which I finally [found the answer to here](http://pastebin.com/112KEHSV).
Finally, I [learned from over here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24363935) how to add things to the System Keychain.
